# Kilo Test day task - quiz implementation

Using React create an application that handles mocked API response, saves it to a global state, and renders it to the client. Also, the application should be able to manage our business logic:

- Prepare dynamic structure for easy implementation with additional quiz types in the future
- Quiz answers saved to the storage
- Questions may depend on each other. Feel free to modify the API response mock.
- Handle custom and native back buttons behavior per question
- Each question key should be pushed to the browser history
- Methods and components should be reusable for further development

Preferred tech stack: React, Redux, Typescript and styled-components. However, use the stack you know best, do not experiment, the goal is to show your best skills.

Note: Do not concentrate on the design, it is not the priority of today's task!

Do not hesitate to ask questions or communicate during test day. It's a real life task and any resources possible should be used to complete the task as fast as possible.
